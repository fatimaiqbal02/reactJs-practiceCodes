## Challenge Description

In this challenge, I used the concepts learned in previous challenges. Moreover, I learned how to create reusable components, pass props to components, 
destructuring props, and efficiently render arrays of components, Conditional rendering, etc.

## Design

I'm excited to apply these valuable lessons in future projects and explore even more advanced React concepts. The world of React has opened up a realm of possibilities, and I'm eager to continue my learning journey.
