# React Info Static Page 
Welcome to my first React challenge! 

## Challenge Description
In this initial challenge of the course, I embarked on a journey to create an efficient React info static page. My primary focus was on optimizing the performance of the page by understanding the concept of virtual DOM and understanding React's rendering capabilities using ReactDOM.render. I learned how to create reusable functional
components and how to render the React components to the HTML document.

## Project Highlights
1. Virtual DOM
2. Reusable Functional Components
3. Rendering Optimization

## Design

The UI design for this challenge was provided in a Figma file. You can find the Figma design here:
