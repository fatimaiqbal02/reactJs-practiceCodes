# Digital Business Card Challenge 
Welcome to my Digital Business Card project! 

## Challenge Description
In this solo project, I embarked on a captivating journey to create a Digital Buisness Card in React. My main focus was on optimizing the page's performance by understanding the concept of the Virtual DOM and leveraging React's rendering capabilities using ReactDOM.render. I delved into creating reusable functional components and seamlessly rendering React components to the HTML document.

## Project Highlights
- **Virtual DOM:** I mastered the power of React's Virtual DOM, enabling me to efficiently update the actual DOM and enhance the overall page performance.
- **Reusable Functional Components:** By creating modular and reusable functional components, I achieved clean code organization and reduced redundancy.
- **Rendering Optimization:** Through rendering optimization techniques, I ensured that the React components rendered smoothly, providing a seamless user experience.
