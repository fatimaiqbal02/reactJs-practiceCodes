## Challenge Description

It is the solo project in the course, I learned how to create an efficient React info static page. My primary focus was on optimizing the performance of the page by understanding the concept of virtual DOM and understanding React's rendering capabilities using ReactDOM.render. I learned how to create reusable functional
components and how to render the React components to the HTML document.

## Project Highlights

1. Virtual DOM
2. Reusable Functional Components
3. Rendering Optimization
