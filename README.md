Welcome to my reactJs-practiceCodes repository!
 
 # <h3>Introduction</h3>
 
This GitHub repository documents my journey of learning React through the comprehensive React course on 'scrimba.com'. As an aspiring React developer, 
I embarked on this learning journey to master the art of building dynamic and interactive user interfaces using React. 
This repository serves as a personal record of my progress, showcasing the solutions I developed during the course to strengthen my understanding
of React principles and best practices.

Here, you will find my solutions to various code challenges and exercises that are part of the course. As I progressed through the course, 
I actively solved code challenges to reinforce my  understanding of React concepts and enhance my coding skills. I have delved deep into these concepts 
to gain hands-on experience. All the codes neat and are written in well organized manner.

# <h3>Features</h3>
The repository includes:

- A collection of code challenges and exercises, covering React fundamentals, state management, component composition, hooks, and more.
- Organized folder structure for each section and module, providing easy navigation and readability.
- Concise and well-commented code, providing insights into my thought process and implementation approach.
- Continuous updates and improvements as I progress through the course and further enhance my React skills.
- Link to the challenges in readmeFiles in each section.

# <h3>Repository Stucture</h3>
The repository is structured in such a way that each directory contains my solutions to code challenges and exercises in the React course. Each folder contains a README file with a link to the Figma challenge (UI).
